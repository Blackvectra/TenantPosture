# Known issues

Things that are known, not hidden, and not blocking. Each says what happens, why, and what to do
meanwhile. A fix is its own change, not part of the pull request that recorded it.

## Web GUI (`-Web`)

The server shell, the run list, the report viewer and the tenant box were exercised on a real
workstation (see CHANGELOG). Starting a scan from the page has not been run end to end against a
tenant.

- **Runs from the command line are not listed.** The GUI lists runs saved under
  `output\<domain>\`, which is where a scan started from the GUI writes. A command-line run writes
  flat files into `output\`, so it does not appear in the GUI's run list. Open the report from the
  output folder instead.
- **The report site is not linked.** The GUI opens the single-page `*-assessment.html` report only.
  The multi-page report site (`<base>-report\`) is in the output folder; the GUI does not link to it.
- **Calling `Start-NRGWebServer` directly needs `-ScriptDir`.** Its default points at `Lib`, where
  the `Web` folder does not exist. `Invoke-NRGAssessment.ps1 -Web` passes the right folder, so normal
  use is not affected.
- **Pode is a separate install.** `Install-Module Pode` fails on a machine whose PowerShellGet or
  NuGet layer is broken; `Install-PSResource` or `Save-PSResource` works without NuGet.
- **The tests that start a real server run only where Pode is installed.** CI skips them. Run
  `Testing/NRG.WebServer.Tests.ps1` locally with Pode installed.

## Not yet run against a live tenant

Covered by tests against stubbed or mock data only: the batch runners, the triage deep-dive of other
users' mailboxes, the email assessment on an account that has a mailbox, endpoint compliance
collection (`Device/` and `-DeviceResults`), delta and monthly reports from two real runs, the SSP
answers file and questionnaire import, `Apply-NRGBaseline.ps1`, the tenant app registration and
consent scripts, and the Settings Catalog parsers. Issue #98 (the authentication strength read that
returned a 400 on 2026-09-24) still needs a live confirmation that it no longer recurs.

## Collection limits seen on a real tenant

- **PVW-2.6 (auto-labeling):** `Get-AutoSensitivityLabelPolicy` is absent in the Security &
  Compliance session when the signed-in account lacks the Purview role or license that grants it. The
  control reads "not assessed" and the Exceptions list names the likely cause.
- **Mailbox reads on an account with no mailbox:** the incident-response email assessment reports
  NOT CLEARED and says the account may have no Exchange Online mailbox. Run it on an account that has
  one.
